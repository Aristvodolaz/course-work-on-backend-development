Key Features:
Model Creation for Entity Representation:

The project includes the creation of a dedicated model that represents the core entity, which, in this context, is files. The model facilitates interactions with the database, adhering to Laravel's eloquent ORM principles.
Database Migration for Structured Data Storage:

To ensure efficient data handling, a database migration has been implemented. This process emphasizes the importance of structuring the database schema and managing changes effectively over time. Practical experience with migrations is gained through the creation and modification of the database schema.
Eloquent for Database Querying:

The Eloquent ORM is utilized for seamless and expressive database queries. Queries are specifically designed to interact with file-related data, showcasing the advantages and convenience of using Eloquent for model and data manipulation.
